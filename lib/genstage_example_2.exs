defmodule GenstageExample2 do
  @moduledoc """
  This is an example of a simple four stage GenStage flow. It features a multi-input stage - an adder that requires two values and computes their sum. For a more detailed
  explanation, please see this blog [post](www.elixirfbp.com)

  The example is meant to illustrate how to
  1. design a multi-input stage, and
  2. allow for the uneven appearances of input events.

  Two examples of flows are possible - see the comments at the bottom for directions:
  1. Two Constant stages feed a Sum stage whose output is asked for by a
  Timer stage.
  2. Two enumerated flows feed a Sum stage whose output is asked for by a
  Timer stage.

  ## To run:

  1. cd genstage_example_2
  2. mix deps.get
  3. mix run lib/genstage_example_2.exs
